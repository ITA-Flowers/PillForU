## Challenge[^chl]

### Internet of Things

IoT has the power to change our world. From cities and transportation, to the resources we farm, emerging IoT technologies are set to make everyday processes more integrated and easier.

Thanks to IoT, we can:
- reduce waste and improve service delivery,
- create good ideas for disabled persons and seniors,
- have a control of hospitals resources,
- make an optimization in patient care,
- automobiles operate,
- save our time and money.

IoT helps us work smarter, live smarter, and gain complete control over our lives, but it’s also supporting our wellbeing behind the scenes. And it is just a beginning!

Now you can show how IoT can make our lives easier.
